dragon slayers who often wins(I think you know what I mean).<br>You can see some of these in <a href="legends.html">Dragon Legends</a>
</p>
<p class="p2">
The history of dragon stretches far back,<br>since 4000 bc.Dragons have been in <br>lots and lots of stories,
for example,the<br>Jabberwocker from Alice in Wonderland.
</p>
<p class="p2">
Every culture has their own idea of<br>dragons.In western countries,dragons<br>are fearsome creatures with razor-<br>
sharp teeth, strong talons, steel-<br>hard scaes and breathe fire or poisonious fumes.<br>Eastern countries consider
dragons as a more peaceful, wise and kind creature.<br>They have no wings(exept one type),<br>have a long snake-like
body with legs.It has sines going down its back.<br>Its head is big also it has horns.It also has a beard.
